@Description: Allure annotation to provide a description for the test method.
Elements (Page Factory):
WebElement: Represents an HTML element on the page.
@FindBy: Used to find elements in the HTML structure based on different locators like XPath, CSS, etc.
@FindAll: Helps to find elements matching any of the given locators.
WebDriver and Assertions:
WebDriver: Interface for interacting with web browsers. Used for browser automation.

These elements, annotations, and keywords are crucial in Selenium test automation, specifically when using Page Factory pattern for page object modeling and Allure for detailed test reporting. They help in organizing and executing tests, locating elements on web pages, waiting for specific conditions, performing actions, and asserting expected outcomes.
